Dao-Droid
==========
---

Dao-droid is the skeleton of an app which needs to handle 
local persistence and data ping-pong with a backend-end server.

This a vanilla approach, in the way that most of such problems have already been solved by 
[retro-fit] (http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
and 
[green-dao] (http://greenrobot.org/greendao/),
which btw I find them to be great tools. Nevertheless, if one feels the need of grasping something from scratch, 
this may be one way to do it.
